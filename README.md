# TM4C123Base
Reference Design for the TM4C123GH6PM for Robotics

This is a MCU board for using the ARM Cortex-M4 TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller in small robotics.

It is the same MCU as the TI TM4C123 Launchpad: http://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL except all pins are available, and the hibernate circuit works. It also has a CMOS battery enabling the RTC functions, and hibernate and wake-up operations. It can turn on/off an external power supply.
